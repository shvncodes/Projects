            <div class="box">Slow-motion video of a singing male katydid Conocephalus fuscus. Many crickets sing at
                ultrasonic frequencies inaudible to human. This video has been slowed down by a factor of four. By
                slowing it down, the singing sound becomes audible to humans. </div>
            <div class="box">The Seattle Kraken throughout their history have been primarily televised on Root Sports
                Northwest and radio broadcast primarily on KJR-FM. The Kraken compete in the National Hockey League as a
                member of the Pacific Division of the Western Conference and began play during the league's 2021–22
                season. John Forslund serves as the team's television play-by-play announcer. J. T. Brown is the
                Kraken's primary television color analyst. In August 2022, the team hired Eddie Olczyk to be a
                television analyst alongside Forslund and Brown. Everett Fitzhugh serves as the team's primary radio
                play-by-play announcer. He is the first Black full-time play-by-play announcer in NHL history. Dave
                Tomlinson served as Fitzhugh's color analyst for the Kraken's first two seasons, before resigning in
                August 2023. The Kraken hired commentator Al Kinisky to replace him.</div>

            The American avocet (Recurvirostra americana) is a large wader in the avocet and stilt family,
            Recurvirostridae, found in North America. It spends much of its time foraging in shallow water or on mud
            flats, often sweeping its bill from side to side in water as it seeks crustacean and insect prey. The bird
            is around 40–51 cm (16–20 in) in length and has a bill which is black, pointed, and curved slightly upwards
            towards the tip. Its breeding habitat consists of marshes, beaches, prairie ponds, and shallow lakes in the
            Midwestern United States and southern Canada. This American avocet was photographed in Jamaica Bay Wildlife
            Refuge East Pond, New York City, United States.</div>
